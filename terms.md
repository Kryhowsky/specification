# Technical terms
## Event driven
In event-driven communication the goal is to convey what happens to a loan application rather than a series of changes in a loan application. This allows the parties to be more flexible in their internal representation of the loan-application and the process.
This is currently the norm but in most loan-broker APIs but this standard attempts to clarify which events should be used and how they should be transferred.


## Producer
The party sending a particular event. This term should be interpreted as defined in the CloudEvents specification.
In this specification a producer should send a message by instigating a connection over the http-protocol as specified in [Cloud events HTTP transportbinding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/http-transport-binding.md)

## Consumer
The party receiving an event. This term should be interpreted as defined in the CloudEvents specification.
In this specification a producer should send a message by receiving a http-connection on a specific endpoint as specified in [Cloud events HTTP transportbinding](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/http-transport-binding.md)
